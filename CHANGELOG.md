# 1.1.1 (unreleased)

* Ensured that keys used within a `Bag` are always symbol. This make
  sure that it is possible to retrieve a value with any access method.
  See [GH-9](https://github.com/maoueh/nugrant/issues/9).
* Now using [multi_json](https://rubygems.org/gems/multi_json)
  for JSON handling.

# 1.1.0 (May 17th, 2013)

* Rewrite completely classes `Parameters` and `Bag`.
* Reduced chances to have a parameter name collapsing with an
  implementation method.
* Removed dependency on `deep_merge`. We do now perform
  our own merge.
* Added possibility to iterate through keys by using
  `.each`:

  ```
  config.user.local.each do |name, value|
    puts "Key #{name}: #{value}"
  end
  ```

### Backward Incompatibilities

* `Parameters` is not extending the `Bag` class anymore.
* `Parameters` and `Bag` attributes and methods are now almost
  all prefixed with __ to reduce clashes to a minimum when
  accessing parameters with method-like syntax
  (i.e. `parameters.git.master` instead of `parameters['git']['master']`)

# 1.0.1 (April 9th, 2013)

* Fixed a crash when `user` config value is `nil` preventing `vagrant user parameters`
  from working as expected. [GH-4](https://github.com/maoueh/nugrant/issues/4)
* Fixed a bug preventing the version from being printed when doing `vagrant user -v`.

# 1.0.0 (March 21th, 2013)

* For now on, this gem will follow semantic versioning.
* Refactored how Vagrant plugin is architectured.
* Now supporting Vagrant 1.1.x (Plugin version "2").
